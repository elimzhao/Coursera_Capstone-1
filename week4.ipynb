    "First i download data about New york city and restaurents. Then in 2nd step, i will arrange that data in structured form and  filter the data according to location ,locality,population and number of indian restaurent. Through data analysis i will find out how these restaurent are doing. For Example in terms of demand and suply of indian food. I will create clusters on the basis of number of restaurents in neighbourhoods. With the help of clustering i can easily find out which neighbourhood has less compition for restaurent bussiness. After clustering i plot these cluster on map , which can help my client in better understanding and visiualization. "
